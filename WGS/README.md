# Whole genome sequencing

For whole genome sequencing we used the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB, NIST) NA12878/HG001 pilot sample provided by the PrecisionFDA. Then, we ran our variant calling pipeline. First, we perform reads alignment with BWA-MEM and then, variants are called using the HaplotypeCaller from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).
